         <h2 class="title"> History of sports supplements</h2>
          <p>Sports players had always had special diets with balanced food to make their training better and to keep healthy,
            even when the the sports as we know nowadays barely existed. In the ancient greek empire,
            people who participated in the olympic games had a diet high in meat, bread and wine.
            <img class="image2" src="https://e00-marca.uecdn.es/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2019/11/21/15743648562818.jpg" alt="Carrera de 1904" title="Carrera de 1904">
            At the end of the 19th century, people who played in the new olymplic games usted to have some alcohol dosis before the races,
            but the restictions started in the 1904 olympic games in San Luis,
            when Thomas Hicks had a dosis of strychnine with some egg whites and brandy,
            thing that made him win the race but almost kill him whe he cossed the finish line.</p>
            <p>In the 50s, sports players discoverded a new kind of plant that could help them.
            Ephedra and Ephedrine, were vey popular among the competitive soports world, until it became illegal.</br>
            The kind of supplements we all know, anyway, were created on the second half of the XX century,
            and were derived of natural serums, like cow milk serum, with great figures as the Weider brothers and Irving jhonson,
            who really help to the creation of these.</br>
           In the year 2000, the doctor Scott Conelly created the MET-rx formula for Sports supplements, that is consider the best one in the market.

          <h2 class="title">Supplements and steroids</h2>
          <p>Many times society can´t see the diference between sports supplements and anabolic steroids,
            maybe because the way movies and tv series show the sports and gym world, even if this two kind of sustances are completly different.</br>
            Sports supplemets are derived of natural products as cow milk serum (the famous WHEY protein),
            many times the intake of this are by pills or powders and their objective is to help the processes that are natural in the human body.</p>
            <img class="image2" src="https://d23o500odzh64r.cloudfront.net/media/catalog/product/1/9/190403_bcaa_500.jpg" alt="Aminoacidos BCAA" title="Aminoacidos BCAA">
            <p>As an example, we have Creatine, a powder that helps to encrease the muscular regeneration and the resistance doing different activities,
            specially the gym reps. Another example may be the BCAA amino acids, that complement the muscular regeneration by speeding up it´s velocity and helping the increase the mass you can produce.</br>
            None of this supplements is addictive and have no side effects.

          <h2 class="title">Conclussion</h2>
         <p>This sustances are really useful in the training time, and depending on who you ask, sometimes are considerated as necesary for high performance trainings, 
            many years of investigation were necesary to create them and they are aproved by the scientific and pharmaceutical communities, you can even buy them on the pharmacies.</p></br>
            Even if there are people who´s still afraid of using them, there´s no doubt that tey´re historically important to reach the advances that we have nowadays in all kinds of sports.
